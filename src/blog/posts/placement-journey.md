description: "A real college placement story about patience, rejections, timing, and how effort always finds its moment."

In college placements, we usually see only two outcomes:  
**Selected** or **Rejected**.

But behind every “Selected” badge, there is a story.  
And behind every “Rejected” mail, there is an even bigger one.

This is the story of my friend.

I got placed early — **Deloitte, January**.  
He didn’t.

Not because he lacked skill.  
Not because he didn’t work hard.  
But because placements are not only about effort.  
They are also about timing, decimals, and things no syllabus prepares you for.

## Where It All Started 🚀

In 4th semester, **Code with Cisco** came.

We barely knew C syntax.  
The OA was in Python/Java.  
We couldn’t even attempt it.

Then came **JP Morgan – Code for Good**.  
We had syntax knowledge, but not real problem-solving depth.  
Another rejection.

Then **Fidelity**.

He wrote the OA from home.  
Power fluctuated.  
Laptop mode changed.  
The assessment software kicked him out.

He laughed and said,  
> “Bro, my luck is cursed.”

I said,  
> “Unlucky day. Move on.”

We didn’t know how many times we would repeat that line.

## Deloitte – When Paths Split

January.  
467 students. Two batches.

He wrote first.  
I wrote later.

I solved all three questions — one even by hardcoding.  
My goal wasn’t to crack the company.  
It was just to reach the interview and gain experience.

I got shortlisted.  
He didn’t.

I became the first in our friend circle to get placed.

He smiled.  
But I could see it.

This time, luck didn’t just delay him.  
It separated us.

## The Long Middle 🕰️

**February** – JLR, NI  
**March–April** – No companies  
**May** – MSCI, NetApp

- **JLR** – He wrote the OA, but at that time he was still new to DSA. The questions were tough. Didn’t clear.  
- **NI** – OA done. No next round.  
- **NetApp** – Shortlisted only by CGPA. Some students missed by *0.0x*. He missed too.

Then came a notice:  
> *Placed students can’t attend further companies.*

Now I was blocked.  
He was still fighting.

For the first time, I felt what he felt —  
**Being willing, but unable.**

---

## Almost There

He cleared **Morgan Stanley’s** OA.  
Interview at **8:30 AM**.

Placement office wasn’t open.  
He sat in a classroom.  
Students entered. Disturbance.

He shifted mid-interview.

**Not selected.**

Another friend had a later slot.  
Quiet room. Smooth process.  
**Selected.**

Was that the reason?  
We’ll never know.

But these tiny differences  
are what he always called *luck*.

## The “Only Names” Phase (That Hurt the Most)

These months were brutal:

- **Thomson Reuters, AppLogic, Ruckus, Applied Materials, Western Digital**  
  → All CGPA-based  
  → Didn’t even get to write the OA  
  → *Not rejected by skill. Rejected by a number.*

- **Sabre**  
  → He didn’t register, stuck in Cisco tension, hoping that would work.

- **Juspay**  
  → One of the toughest OAs. Tried hard. Didn’t clear.

- **Schneider Electric (SDE)**  
  → Complex OA. No shortlist.

- **Zeta**  
  → Many solved the same number of test cases.  
  → His submission was a little later.  
  → Not shortlisted.

- **Amagi Labs**  
  → Deep, rigorous screening.  
  → Gave his best. Didn’t clear.

- **Lam Research**  
  → OA went well.  
  → Shortlisting felt random.  
  → No interview call.

- **HPE & later Schneider roles**  
  → OA done.  
  → Shortlist never came.

Each one hurt in a different way:

- *“Not good enough yet”* – JLR, NI  
- *“Blocked by CGPA”* – TR, AppLogic, Ruckus, Applied, WD  
- *“Missed by timing”* – Zeta  
- *“Did well, still no call”* – Lam, HPE  
- *“Too tough”* – Juspay, Amagi  

And yet… he kept showing up.

## Cisco – The Breaking Point

Second **Code with Cisco**.

I failed.  
He solved.

He prepared for weeks.

**Interview → Group Discussion.**  
10 students.  
Only 2 selected.

He spoke well.  
Clear. Confident.

Still eliminated.

Just before this, **RingCentral** came.  
He skipped it, trusting Cisco.

Both gone.

That day, I had no words.

He didn’t cry.  
He just became quiet.

Hope didn’t die.  
It became heavy.

## When Everything Aligned ✨

December.

**Nemeschek** came for a **Gen-AI (Agentic AI)** role.

This matched him perfectly:

- Agentic AI  
- Hackathon-winning project  
- Real hands-on work  

For the first time —  
**Effort met timing.**

He got selected.

## For Every Junior Reading This

- Luck can make placement easy.  
- But **effort makes it inevitable.**

Some get it early.  
Some get it late.  
Some get it after everything breaks.

But the ones who **stay** —  
they always reach.

You are not late.  
You are just being prepared for the right moment.

I shared my friend’s journey, but in truth, it represents the story of many students out there who are walking the same path of patience, rejections, and relentless effort.

> **Hope is a good thing.  
> And good things never die. ❤️**
