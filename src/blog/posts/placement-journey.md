In college placements, we usually see only two outcomes:  
**Selected** or **Rejected**.

But behind every “Selected” badge, there is a story.  
And behind every “Rejected” mail, there is an even bigger one.

This is the story of my friend.

I got placed early — **Deloitte, January**.  
He didn’t.

Not because he lacked skill.  
Not because he didn’t work hard.  
But because placements are not only about effort.  
They are also about timing, decimals, and things no syllabus prepares you for.

I watched his journey from the sidelines—helpless, sometimes guilty, but mostly in awe. If you think your luck is bad, read this. If you think effort doesn't pay off, definitely read this.

## **The Prequel: Where It All Started** 🚀

It started way back in the **4th Semester**.

**Code with Cisco** came.
We barely knew C syntax. The OA (Online Assessment) was in Python/Java. We couldn’t even attempt it.

Then came **JP Morgan – Code for Good**.  
We had syntax knowledge, but not real problem-solving depth. Another rejection.

**Fidelity**.
He took the test from home. He has an **Asus TUF** gaming laptop.
Mid-test, the power cut. The laptop switched from **Turbo Mode** (Performance) to **Silent Mode** (Battery). The screen flickered for a millisecond.
The proctoring software detected a "system change." **Kicked out.**

He laughed and said,  
> “Bro, my luck is cursed.”

I said,  
> “Unlucky day. Move on.”

We didn’t know how many times we would repeat that line.

## **Deloitte – When Paths Split**

January. 467 students. Two batches.

**He wrote first (Batch 1):** Array, String, Graph. All hard-level. He solved one.
**I wrote later (Batch 2):** Similar topics, but the logic was clickable.

I solved all three questions — one even by hardcoding. My goal wasn’t to crack the company; it was just to reach the interview and gain experience.

**The result:**
I got shortlisted. He didn’t.

I cleared the interview and became the first in our friend circle to get placed.
He smiled. But I could see it.

This time, luck didn’t just delay him.  
That was the moment our paths diverged.

## **The Long Middle: The Grind & The CGPA Wall** 🕰️

**February** – JLR, NI  
**March–April** – No companies  
**May** – MSCI, NetApp

- **JLR:** He wrote the OA, but at that time he was still new to DSA. The questions were tough. Didn’t clear.  
- **NI:** OA done. No next round.  
- **NetApp:** Shortlisted only by CGPA. Some students missed by *0.0x*. He missed too.

Around this time, a new rule dropped: **"Placed students cannot sit for other companies."**

I was officially benched.  
He was still fighting.

For the first time, I felt what he felt —  
**Being willing, but unable.**

## **The "Almost" Moments**

Then came **Morgan Stanley**.
He cleared the OA. Interview scheduled for **8:30 AM, Virtual**.
The placement office hadn’t opened yet. He sat in an empty classroom nearby to give the interview.
Mid-interview, a class full of students walked in for a lecture. Chaos. Distraction. He had to relocate while the interviewer waited.

**Result:** Not Selected.

Another friend had a later slot. Quiet room. Smooth process. **Selected.**

Was that the reason? We’ll never know.
But these tiny differences are what he always called *luck*.

## **The “Only Names” Phase (That Hurt the Most)**

These months were brutal.

- **Thomson Reuters, AppLogic, Ruckus, Applied Materials, Western Digital** → All CGPA-based.  
  → Didn’t even get to write the OA.  
  → *Not rejected by skill. Rejected by a number.*

- **Sabre** → He didn’t register, stuck in Cisco tension, hoping that would work.

- **Juspay** → One of the toughest OAs. Tried hard. Didn’t clear.

- **Schneider Electric (SDE)** → Complex OA. No shortlist.

- **Zeta** → Many solved the same number of test cases. His submission was a little later. Not shortlisted.

- **Amagi Labs** → Deep, rigorous screening. Gave his best. Didn’t clear.

- **Lam Research, HPE & later Schneider roles** → OA went well. Shortlisting felt random. No interview call.

Each one hurt in a different way.
*“Not good enough yet”* (JLR). *“Blocked by CGPA”* (AppLogic). *“Missed by timing”* (Zeta).

And yet… he kept showing up.

## **Cisco – The Breaking Point**

Second **Code with Cisco**.

I failed. He solved.
He prepped for weeks. He even skipped **RingCentral** (which matched his AI skills perfectly) just to focus on Cisco.

**The Round:** Group Discussion (GD).
**Topic:** *COVID impact on Supply Chain.*
He spoke well—confident, clear, generalized points.

**Result:** Out of 10 people in his group, 2 were selected. He wasn't one of them.

RingCentral was gone. Cisco was gone.
That day, he didn't say much. He just went quiet. Deep down, he was shattered.

Hope didn’t die.  
It just became heavy.

## **The Marathon of Rejections (Aug - Nov)**

He went into "Auto-Pilot Mode." Just show up, write test, accept rejection, repeat.

* **Aurigo:** Selected for a **Testing role**. He skipped it. He wanted SDE or AI. A bold move for a guy with no offers, but he stuck to his guns.
* **SanDisk (Sept):** Selected for interview! They needed immediate joiners. He was kept on "Hold." Then... dropped.
* **OpenText:** AI Intern role. Matched his profile perfectly. Rejected after OA.
* **Tejas Networks:** He cleared the OA. The interview was tough with high technical depth. He came out smiling, saying, *"I gave my best."* He wasn't selected, but he was satisfied with his performance.
* **IDFC First Bank (Nov):** Selected for interview. It went really well. But banks usually prefer Java. He was a Python/C++ guy. Rejected.
* **Rapido:** Rejected.

## **The "Day Before Graduation" Scare (Dec)**

**WDC (Western Digital)** came in December.
Role: **Python Tester** (High package, PPO potential).
It suited his skills perfectly. He wrote the test.
**Result:** Not shortlisted for interview.

He joked, *"Bro, I think I'll get placed the day before graduation."*
He was laughing, but I knew he was tired.

---

## **The Climax: When Everything Aligned** ✨

December.

**Nemeschek** arrived.
Role: **Gen-AI (Agentic AI) Intern**.

This wasn't just "another company."
He had won a Hackathon previously using **Agentic AI**. He knew this tech inside out.

**The Interview:**
He didn't just answer questions; he showed them his work. He spoke about his project, the architecture, the agents.
The interviewer wasn't just checking boxes; they were impressed.

You know that dialogue? *"Agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho..."* (If you want something with all your heart, the universe conspires to give it to you—but only if you want it with all your heart ❤️‍🔥).

It wasn't luck. It was the specific convergence of his Hackathon grind, his AI interest, and his patience waiting for the *right* role.

For the first time — **Effort met timing.**

**Result: SELECTED.**

## **What I Learned From His Story** 🎯

This journey taught me things no placement PPT ever will:

- **CGPA matters more than you think.** Many high-package on-campus companies use CGPA as the *first filter* — no OA, no chance. Try to keep it **above 8**. Even a *0.xy* difference can decide whether you get to write the test.

- **Take guidance from seniors.** Connect with seniors who are currently facing the market or just got placed. Their grasp of the *current* reality and interview patterns is often more valuable than general advice.

- **Core subjects will come from your semesters.** But **coding** is something *you* must build outside the syllabus.

- **Master one language deeply.** Choose **C++ / Python / Java** — just one. Coding skill > Syntax knowledge.

- **Start early.** Begin in **3rd semester**. By the time you reach **5th semester**, you should already be comfortable with DSA and OAs.

- **Participate in hackathons.** They give you real stories to tell in interviews. Projects + experience > certificates.

- **Don’t wait for “perfect preparation.”** Write every OA. Attend every interview. Even failures teach you the pattern.

- **Luck can make placement easy, but effort makes it inevitable.** Some get it early. Some get it late. Some get it after everything breaks.

But the ones who **stay** — they always reach.

You are not late. You are just being prepared for the right moment.

I shared my friend’s journey, but in truth, it represents the story of many students out there who are walking the same path of patience, rejections, and relentless effort.

> **Hope is a good thing.  
> And good things never die.** ❤️

To my friend (you know who you are)—you taught me more about patience in one year than engineering taught me in four.
