In this post, I'll share some insights from building modern React applications.

## Component Architecture

One of the most important aspects of React development is structuring your components properly.

### Key Principles

1. **Keep components small and focused** - Each component should do one thing well
2. **Use custom hooks** - Extract logic into reusable hooks
3. **Embrace composition** - Build complex UIs from simple components

## State Management

Managing state effectively is crucial for maintaining a clean codebase.

## Performance Optimization

Here are some techniques I use to keep my apps fast:
- Lazy loading components
- Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Code splitting with dynamic imports

## Conclusion

Building great React apps takes practice, but following these principles will set you on the right path.
